            <h5><b>Five Things to Know if You’re Road-Tripping This Summer</b></h5>
            <img src="media/news 3.JPG" alt="1" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto" /><br />
            <p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify">
              Rising vaccination rates and pent-up demand are expected to speed up travel’s rebound this summer. In addition to tips from the Before Times — get your car serviced, load up on snacks and be open to the possibility of
              adventure — here are five things to keep in mind if you’re planning a road trip this year.<br />
              1. You won’t be alone. <br />
              Although many travelers last summer enjoyed the retro appeal of wide-open roads relatively free of crowds, this summer is likely to have distinctly 21st-century levels of traffic. So, it seems that you wont have a good day
              only by yourself.<br />
              2. Crossing state lines will be easier than it was last summer. But don’t toss the masks just yet.<br />
              Although road-trippers can more freely cross state lines this summer than last, pandemic laws — and culture — still varies from place to place.<br />
              3. Rental cars will be hard to come by, so plan ahead and be flexible.<br />
              Rental cars are scarce: A recent easy.com search for a rental car for the Fourth of July weekend — with a pickup on July 1 and drop-off on July 5 at the International Airport — showed no availability.<br />
              4. Research well, book in advance and brace for closures.<br />
              It is so important to do research first before having a trip on a road vacation. The key to navigating these roadblocks? Check the individual websites for your destination — and its attractions and restaurants — for the latest
              health protocols and information about openings and closures, and make reservations as far as possible in advance.<br />
              5. Prepare for what could be long stretches in the car.<br />
              The Federal Highway Administration does not keep a national log of construction projects, and aside from researching planned work on transportation department websites and listening to local news, consumer-facing apps — like
              Waze and Google Maps, which show real-time traffic and construction — is the best way to keep abreast of what to expect.<br />

                <p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify">
                  After you’ve finally given your big “Yes!” to a proposal, it’s now time to give your big “I do.” As exciting as this may be, you also have to prepare for it to be filled with a lot of emotions, stress, and even a few
                  anxious moments. There’s a lot to prepare before your wedding day, to make it the best day of your life.<br />
                  Of the many details you need to plan, one of the most important is your wedding car.<br />
                  1. You Have a Choice of Luxury and One-Of-A-Kind Cars<br />
                  2. You Can Begin Your Big Day In Style!<br />
                  3. Be Relaxed and Comfortable<br />
                  4. Feel Extra Special<br />
                  5. More Opportunities for Great Photos<br />
                  If you’ve long been dreaming about your wedding day, and the extravagant ways you could arrive at your venue, this can become a reality. When you focus on all the finer details of your big day, don’t forget to consider the
                  wedding car you’re going to use. Planning this early is essential to ensure the car supplier has the vehicle you desire.<br />

                <p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify">
                  In this golden age of RV travel, with ownership at an all-time high and myriad new ways to book a getaway, exploring RV campgrounds is as exciting as embarking on the journey itself. Spectacular RV-only destinations are
                  bookable through membership programs like Harvest Hosts, boon docking on public land is easier than ever via Campendium, and national park campgrounds can now be easily reserved with the Recreation.gov app. Since the idea
                  of RV parks originated in the 1920s with places like Overland Motor Park in Denver, there are now roughly 13,000 across the country. But just because you drive an RV, doesn’t mean you need to be surrounded by them
                  everywhere you go. Whether you’re renting an RV or driving your own camper, these campgrounds—from the world’s largest dark sky sanctuary in Minnesota to a volcano in Maui—are breathtaking basecamps for adventure. To
                  inspire your next road trip, here are the 3 best RV-friendly campgrounds in the country.<br />
                  1. Trail's End Campground, Superior National Forest, Minnesota<br />

                <p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify">
                  Production of the Ford Fiesta at the automaker's factory in Cologne, Germany, could be halted until April 25. Workers at the factory were on short time work last week. This will continue until Easter, Ford said. After
                  Easter, production will be halted for a previously scheduled two-week vacation pause, meaning that April 25 is the likely restart date. Ford did not disclose the reason for the prolonged production stoppage, The Bild
                  newspaper reported that the automaker is having difficulty sourcing some components, which are likely to include cable harnesses built in Ukraine. Ford has already suspended output at the plant a number of times due to a
                  shortage of semiconductors from Asia, a problem that persists. Production of a new midsize crossover will start this year using technology from the VW ID4. A second vehicle, which Ford has said will be a "sports
                  crossover," will also be built at Cologne starting in 2024. The vehicle is also expected to be based on the MEB platform.
